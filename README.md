# **Hacktoberfest Open Source Challenge 3.0**

Welcome to the Hacktoberfest Open Source Challenge 3.0 organized by the Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors Community in collaboration with the [GitHub Campus Experts, Unilag Community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/IgY7V6RXFcwFkhLlnvOGKq)! We're thrilled to have you on board for this exciting journey of collaboration and open-source contributions.

## **About the Challenge**

This year the Hacktoberfest ML/AI Open-Source Challenge focuses on **one flagship project — Naija Nutri Hub**.

**Naija Nutri Hub** is an end-to-end, AI-powered food platform focused on **Nigerian food**. The goal is a practical, production-ready tool that combines computer vision, nutrition knowledge, recipe generation, and local discovery into a single experience. Participants can contribute across ML/AI engineering, [frontend](https://github.com/mlsanigeria/naija-nutri-hub-frontend), backend (with FastAPI), [UI/UX design](https://github.com/mlsanigeria/naija-nutri-hub-frontend), DevOps, and non-technical roles (docs, community, testing).

### Project overview
Naija Nutri Hub allows a user to take or upload a photo of a meal and receive:
- **Food classification** — Identify the dish (single or multiple items in an image).  
- **Nutritional & calorie estimates** — Grounded nutrition facts pulled or reconciled from external APIs/databases.  
- **Recipe suggestions** — Step-by-step cooking recipes (and ingredient/portion guidance) generated or retrieved for the identified dish.  
- **Nearby restaurants** — Recommend local restaurants that sell the same or similar dishes.
